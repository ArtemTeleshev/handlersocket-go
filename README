handlersocket-go
================

Go library for connecting to HandlerSocket Mysql plugin.  See github.com/ahiguti/HandlerSocket-Plugin-for-MySQL/


## Installation

	$ goinstall github.com/bketelsen/handlersocket-go


## Read Example  - Best examples are in the TEST file.

	hs := New()

	// Connect to database
	hs.Connect("127.0.0.1", 9998, 9999)
	defer hs.Close()
	hs.OpenIndex(1, "gotesting", "kvs", "PRIMARY", "id", "content")

	found, _ := hs.Find(1, "=", 1, 0, "brian")

	for i := range found {
			fmt.Println(found[i].Data) 
		}

	fmt.Println(len(found), "rows returned")


## Write Example

	hs := New()
	hs.Connect("127.0.0.1", 9998, 9999) // host, read port, write port
	defer hs.Close()

	// id is varchar(255), content is text
	hs.OpenIndex(3, "gotesting", "kvs", "PRIMARY", "id", "content")

	err := hs.Insert(3,"mykey1","a quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog")

## Known bugs

Implementation isn't complete.  
Working:  OpenIndex, Find, Insert
Not Implemented:  Update/Delete - NEXT


## Credits and acknowledgments

I was heavily inspired by IO code from stomp.go
https://github.com/nf/gostomp/blob/master/stomp.go

Also took some inspiration from the GoMYSQL implementation, although I've backed much of that out in this initial release.
https://github.com/Philio/GoMySQL
I can see how it would be extremely useful for GoMYSQL or GoDBI to use HandlerSocket in the background for simple finds, inserts, etc.


## ChangeLog
