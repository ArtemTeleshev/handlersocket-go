## Credits and acknowledgments

I was heavily inspired by IO code from stomp.go
https://github.com/nf/gostomp/blob/master/stomp.go

Also took some inspiration from the GoMYSQL implementation, although I've backed much of that out in this initial release.
https://github.com/Philio/GoMySQL
I can see how it would be extremely useful for GoMYSQL or GoDBI to use HandlerSocket in the background for simple finds, inserts, etc.
